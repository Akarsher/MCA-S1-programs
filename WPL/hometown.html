<h2>History</h2>
<p>Muvattupuzha was part of the Vadakkumkoor Kingdom until it was seized by the Travancore. Old documents show that parts of the lands of Muvattupuzha belonged to Edappally Swaroopam, but were later transferred to Manas' (Brahmin families).

After Indian independence, from 1949 to 1956, Muvattupuzha was a part of the Kottayam district in Travancore-Cochin state.In 1956, when Kerala state was formed, Muvattupuzha remained as a part of Kottayam district until 1958, when Ernakulam district was formed on 1 April 1958. Muvattupuzha, as a village union, came under the control of a council of three members nominated by the Government. V. P. Govindan Nair was the first president of the village union. By 1953, Muvattupuzha was declared a panchayat. Kunnappillil Varkey Vaidyan was the first president of the elected panchayat committee. Muvattupuzha was raised to the status of a municipality in the year 1958. N. Parameshwaran Nair became the first municipal chairman. Muvattupuzha is the first municipality where the Communist Party came into power in a general election.</p>

        <img src="bridge.jpg" alt="Historical Monument" width="500">
        <p> In 1914, the first concrete bridge in Asia was built in Muvattupuzha under the supervision of the British engineer W.H. Emrald. It is said that on its inauguration, to convince others of the strength and stability of the bridge, Emrald and his wife sat beneath the bridge in a boat while 15 elephants walked over it. This bridge connects Nehru Park and Kacherithazham.

There was a wooden bridge across the river through which the steam bus went from Muvattupuzha to Ernakulam. The border to Kochi state was at Chungam, Mamala, near Thiruvankulam. Until the late 1970s, traffic went over the old concrete bridge. There was a traffic police outpost on either side of the bridge to control one-way traffic. Later in the 1970s, a new bridge was constructed and in the late 1970s the traffic diverted through a wider two-way bridge. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Monument" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
